> We have released another Microsoft Defender for Cloud price estimation workbook that covers all of the following plans:
>
> * Microsoft Defender for App Services

>
> **You can find the new workbook [here](https://github.com/Azure/Microsoft-Defender-for-Cloud/tree/main/Workbooks/Microsoft%20Defender%20for%20Cloud%20Price%20Estimation)**.

This workbook considers all App Services with and without Microsoft Defender for App Services enabled across your selected subscription. The results are from within the last 7 days. 
- The **Estimated Price for 7 days** is based on the hours running the App Service within that period.
- The **Estimated Monthly Price** takes those 7 days as sample and calculates it for a month.
