# Deployment Guide
## This is a Continuous Cloud Security Optimization Dashboard built using Azure Workbooks to enable the customer to quickly gain insights about their Azure Platform security footprint & configuration.

To deploy the new workbook into your Security Center console, click on *Deploy to Azure* for Azure Public cloud or *Deploy to Azure Gov* for government cloud.
During the deployment, you must select a subscription and resource group to store the report. Once the workbook is successfully deployed, head to Security Center to start using it.
