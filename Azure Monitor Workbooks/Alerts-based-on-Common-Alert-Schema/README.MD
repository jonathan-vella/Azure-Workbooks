# Azure Monitor Common Alert Schema

Azure Monitor uses the Common Alert Schema for all alerts. You can read more about the alert schema here. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-common-schema  

The purpose of this repository is to provide real world samples of the schema for Log Search alerts and Metric Alerts. The schema changes slightly based on the types of alerts and what you are alerting on. 

You can read more about how to view your Alert Schemas in my post here. https://www.systemcenterautomation.com/2019/09/logic-apps-examine-azure-monitor-alert-schema/



All GUIDs found in the samples are fake.
